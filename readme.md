Codes are tested against the following environmental setup:
```
Python 3.7
tensorflow 1.15.0
scikit-learn 0.24.2
pandas 1.2.4
numpy 1.20.2
scipy 1.7.0
```

Here we provided the code for training and evaluating GIL/GIL-D using multivariate tabular and sequential data. Each folder is self-contained and has a seperate readme file introducing how to train, evaluate and load pre-trained checkpoints.
